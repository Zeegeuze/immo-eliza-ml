# Immo Eliza Machine Learning

## The Mission
The real estate company Immo Eliza asked you to create a machine learning model to predict prices of real estate properties in Belgium.

After the scraping, cleaning and analyzing, you are ready to preprocess the data and finally build a performant machine learning model!

## Run the program
To get your prediction, go to the main.ipynb notebook and run it. All explanation will be in there.

## Setup of the code
The main notebook will only contain the runtrough: the code is divided into python docs.

We'll have a map for all data, but new and saved.

We'll have a map for all notebooks, being preprocessing, model and predict.

We'll have a map where we save our models and scalers.

And we'll have a map for all the machine learning code, which is divided into a preprocessing, model and predict file.

## Project
This project run for a week.

## Result
Train score is 83.24%
Test Score is 73.88%
---------------------------
The mean absolute error of our model is 96255.765625.
The R2 score of our model is 0.7387530565514333
The mean squared error of our model is 45454159872.0
