# Immo Eliza Machine Learning

## The Mission
The real estate company Immo Eliza asked you to create a machine learning model to predict prices of real estate properties in Belgium.

After the scraping, cleaning and analyzing, you are ready to preprocess the data and finally build a performant machine learning model!

## Run the program
To get your prediction, go to the main.ipynb notebook and run it. All explanation will be in there.

## Setup of the code
The main notebook will only contain the runtrough: the code is divided into python docs.

We'll have a map for all data, but new and saved.

We'll have a map for all preprocessing.

And we'll have a map for all the machine learning code.

## Project
This project run for a week.
